# BraggNet

BraggNet is a proof of concept in using neural networks to integrate Bragg peaks for single crystal measurements.  In particular, it is a way to integrate Bragg peaks from TOF crystallography data collected on the [MaNDi beamline](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/mandi) at the Spallation Neutron Source (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA).  The work is detailed in two publications, which are currently in press:

- Sullivan, B., Archibald, R., Azadmanesh, J., Vandavasi, V., Langan, P.S., Coates, L., Lynch, V., Langan, P. (2019). BraggNet: Integrating Bragg Peaks Using Neural Networks. J. Appl. Cryst. (accepted).

- Sullivan B., Archibald, R., Vandavassi, V., Langan, P.S., Coates, L., Lynch, V. (2019). Volumetric Segmentation via Neural Networks Improves Neutron Crystallography Data Analysis. Proceedings of High-Performance Machine Learning 2019 (IEEE CCGrid2019 Workshop, in press).

We hope this repository will provide a strong starting point for researchers interesting in applying neural networks to their own Bragg peak integration.
